## Better faction relations contract

This contract is to make the scorch faction wars and alliances better and bring more justice. All of this will be managed by matej1181 and its members. If this contract changes i will announce it in BFR (better factions relations) discord server. Both sides need to agree to this contract and be fully aware of it. #

# Issues that this contract fixes

**Unwanted wars:** If you are at war with another faction and other faction wants to war you too, they can ally with your enemy faction and war you without you wanting to. This is commonly abused by Rebels united and few other factions.
**Faction inactivity:** This is already faction rule (Atleast i think, i can't find it now as of writing this), So this contract will enforce it, If faction that is inactive for more than week in war (Inactive: No players online), OR doesn't attend in war (doesn't kill enemies), then the warmay be cancelled.

# requirements

1.This contract need to be sent to all factions attending war, if both sides agree to it.
2.Even if contract is cancelled durning war, BFR still may decide to end the war or not (As mentinoed in [wckd faction war rules](https://discord.com/channels/710308659225165883/947675706652000257/949118826690261002), both sides need to agree to end the war) to prevent abuse.
3.Both factions need to announce in their communication channels about this contract to avoid confusion.

# Faction war rules

**1\. Random killing enemies**
Rking enemies is allowed unless the enemy faction member just exited safe zone (As mentioned in [wckd faction rules](https://discord.com/channels/710308659225165883/947675706652000257/949118826690261002) Enemy factions are Kill on sight against each other).
**2.Creating tickets**
Due to wckd ticket system being so unjustice sometimes, before creating ticket in wckd discord server, create it in BFR discord first.
**3\. Breaking rules**
If any rules are broken in faction war, follow rule 2.

# Notes

For faction members: You can join BFR, it is not faction so you don't need to leave your own. (I identify it as division that anyone can join)
As BFR member you will vote on faction war contract changes.
its called *Democracy*

For leaders: BFR is not "ally" with any factions. This contract was made to prevent current situation happening to Thieves guild and Rebels united (Unwanted wars).
